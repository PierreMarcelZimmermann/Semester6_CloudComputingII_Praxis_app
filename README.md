# Semester6_CloudComputingII_Praxis_app
This is the repository for the app SkySight. This app was created for an exam at DHBW.
## Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:
1. *Frontend*:
The frontend is a Next.js React application that serves as the user interface.
2. *Backend*:
The backend consists of:
   - Flask server: Handles the application logic and API endpoints.
   - Streamlit dashboard: Displays logging data for monitoring and insights.
## Deployment
Local deployment is possible but ill advised and needs tweaking. Use the [deployment repository](https://github.com/PierreMarcelZimmermann/Semester6_CloudComputingII_Praxis_deploy)!
